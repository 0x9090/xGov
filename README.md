## Submitting a Proposal
To submit a proposal, a proposer needs to create a pull request on the repository. 
Proposals must follow the provided [template form](./TemplateForm.md) and be submitted to the folder  `/Proposas/Governance_X`, where X is the upcoming governance period (e.g., Governance_7). Proposals must have the status Final before the end of the temperature check, which is 1.5 months after the start of a governance.

## Threshold
In order for a proposal to be approved, it is necessary for the number of votes in favor of the proposal to be proportionate to the amount of funds requested. This ensures that the allocation of funds is in line with the community's consensus and in accordance with democratic principles.

## Grant Calculation
The allocation of grants will be distributed taking into consideration the funding request amounts. The Algorand foundation will initiate contact with the proposal's author to negotiate final terms and conditions.
